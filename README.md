## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5836833/create-an-array-with-random-values

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I was stuck in working with the tones, I was unable to use the function NextClue because of a missing call.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I want to learn more about how many more things in the web development can be abstracted to be represented by variables rather than constants. I also want to learn more about how we can change
the highlight color, improve design, make the website more neutral and accessible friendly. How to attract traffic to our website, how to add ads to our website. How can we make the site more secure, 
How to deploy a website to a custom domain, how to make it more scalable. Among many other questions I have

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Would have implemented a clock, changed the CSS to prettier shade, abstracted number of buttons, length of sequence, and gave more control to the user. Would have made random buttons to make game more fun and added a point system and a leaderboard.
